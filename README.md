She would go on tour for every album she released starting from her second album "Fearless" to her sixth album "Reputation." However when the pandemic for COVID-19 hit and the world went into a global lockdown, Taylor knew she wouldn't be able to tour for her recent album "Lover." Throught the pandemic, she continued making music and started re-recording her first six albums. By the time the world started to lift restrictions and grew more at ease, Swift had already released 4 albums and not toured them. Being the mastermind she is, she decided she would do a world tour called "The Eras Tour" showing off all 10 of her original albums, even the 4 that had not been toured.
